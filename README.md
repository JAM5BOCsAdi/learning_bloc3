<h1>learning_bloc3</h1>

<p>A MultiBlocProvider app and created a README.md file for a base</p>

<h2>Images</h2>
<p>For uploading images I created a folder [images] inside the project (VSCode) and dragged the images there and made a git commit and push to the repo.</p>

<p>After that I opened each image to see the URL like this: <a href ="https://github.com/JAM5BOCsAdi/learning_bloc3/blob/master/lib/images/img1.jpg">https://github.com/JAM5BOCsAdi/learning_bloc3/blob/master/lib/images/img1.jpg</a></p>

<p>To get these images go inside: .../lib/images/img1.jpg</p>
<p>And Copy the URL in the browser and paste it in the <span>img src="https://github.com/JAM5BOCsAdi/learning_bloc3/blob/master/lib/images/img1.jpg"</span>

<p>First image</p>
<img src="https://github.com/JAM5BOCsAdi/learning_bloc3/blob/master/lib/images/img1.jpg" alt="Preview of Image 1">

<p>Second image</p>
<img src="https://github.com/JAM5BOCsAdi/learning_bloc3/blob/master/lib/images/img2.jpg" alt="Preview of Image 2">
